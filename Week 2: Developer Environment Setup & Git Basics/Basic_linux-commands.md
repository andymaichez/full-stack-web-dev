# Linux for Developers

## 1. Introduction to Linux

### What is Linux?
Linux is an **open-source operating system** modeled on Unix. It powers a vast range of devices — from smartphones to servers and supercomputers. Unlike proprietary systems like Windows or macOS, Linux provides developers full control over the system environment, making it highly preferred in software development and system administration.

### Key Characteristics
- **Open-source**: Its source code is freely accessible, allowing developers to inspect, customize, and improve the operating system.
- **Stability**: Known for its reliability, Linux systems can run for years without needing a reboot.
- **Security**: Based on Unix's robust permissions model and less commonly targeted by malware compared to other systems.
- **Performance**: Efficient and lightweight, making it ideal even on older or low-resource hardware.
- **Flexibility**: Offers granular customization, from the kernel to the graphical interface.

### Why Developers Prefer Linux
- **Powerful Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Tools like Bash, cron jobs, and shell scripts enable high automation and efficiency.
- **Rich Development Ecosystem**: Programming languages, frameworks, databases, and development tools run natively.
- **Containerization & Cloud**: Technologies like Docker and most cloud infrastructures are Linux-based.
- **Version Control & Collaboration**: Native support for Git, SSH, and DevOps pipelines simplifies team collaboration.

### Common Linux Distributions
- **Ubuntu**: User-friendly, great community support, based on Debian.
- **Fedora**: Offers the latest features, maintained by Red Hat.
- **Debian**: Known for stability and long-term support.
- **Arch Linux**: Minimalist, for advanced users who want full control and customization.

## 2. Setting Up the Development Environment

### For Windows Users
Install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) — a Unix-like terminal that lets you run shell commands on Windows.

### For macOS/Linux Users
Use the built-in **Terminal** application.

### Configuring Git (Essential for Version Control)
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
````

This sets up your Git identity globally on your system.

## 3. Basic Navigation Commands

In Linux, navigating the file system via the terminal is similar to exploring folders in a file explorer — but using only your keyboard. The following commands help you locate, access, and understand where you are in the system.

---

### a) `pwd` — Print Working Directory

**Description**: Displays the full path of your current directory.

**Why Use It**: Helps you know exactly where you are in the file system.

**Example**:

```bash
pwd
```

**Sample Output**:

```
/home/andy/Documents/Projects
```

---

### b) `ls` — List Directory Contents

**Description**: Lists files and directories within your current location.

**Basic Usage**:

```bash
ls
```

**Sample Output**:

```
notes.txt  resume.pdf  Photos  Music
```

You can use flags with `ls` to get more detailed information.

#### i) `ls -a` — Show Hidden Files

**Purpose**: Includes files and directories that begin with a dot (`.`), which are hidden by default.

```bash
ls -a
```

**Sample Output**:

```
.  ..  .bashrc  notes.txt  resume.pdf  Photos  Music
```

* `.` – current directory
* `..` – parent directory
* `.bashrc` – a hidden configuration file

#### ii) `ls -lh` — Human-Readable File Sizes

**Purpose**: Displays file sizes in KB, MB, GB, making them easier to understand.

```bash
ls -lh
```

**Sample Output**:

```
-rw-r--r--  1 andy andy 2.1K Jun 25 12:00 notes.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 andy andy 4.3M Jun 25 12:01 resume.pdf
drwxr-xr-x  5 andy andy 4.0K Jun 25 12:02 Photos
```

---

### c) `cd` — Change Directory

**Description**: Navigates into a specified directory.

**Example**:

```bash
cd Documents
```

Moves into the `Documents` folder.

#### `cd` — Go to Home Directory

```bash
cd
```

Equivalent to navigating to:

```
/home/your-username
```

#### `cd ..` — Go Up One Level

```bash
cd ..
```

If you're in `/home/andy/Documents`, this takes you back to `/home/andy`.

---

## Terminal Navigation Example

### Directory Structure

```
/home/andy
├── Documents
│   ├── resume.pdf
│   └── Projects
│       └── website.html
├── Music
└── .bashrc
```

### Navigating Step-by-Step

```bash
cd             # Go to home directory
pwd            # Shows: /home/andy
ls             # Lists: Documents  Music
cd Documents   # Enter Documents folder
ls             # Lists: resume.pdf  Projects
cd Projects    # Enter Projects folder
pwd            # Shows: /home/andy/Documents/Projects
ls             # Lists: website.html
cd ..          # Go back to Documents
cd ..          # Go back to home directory
```

## Summary Table of Navigation Commands

| Command     | Description                 | Use Case                          |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `pwd`       | Show full directory path    | Verify your current location      |
| `ls`        | List files/directories      | View contents of a folder         |
| `ls -a`     | Show hidden files           | Reveal `.git`, `.bashrc`, etc.    |
| `ls -lh`    | Human-readable sizes        | Understand file sizes easily      |
| `cd folder` | Change to a specific folder | Navigate into folders             |
| `cd ..`     | Go up one directory level   | Move back to the parent folder    |
| `cd`        | Go to home directory        | Quickly return to start directory |

> Think of the terminal like navigating a house: `cd` moves you into a room, `..` takes you out, and `ls` lets you see what's inside.

## 4. Directory and File Management

### Key Commands

* `mkdir` – Create a new directory
* `touch` – Create an empty file
* `rmdir` – Remove an empty directory
* `rm -rf` – Forcefully delete directories/files recursively (use with caution)

### Example

```bash
mkdir projects
cd projects
touch index.html
mkdir empty_folder
mkdir old_project/new_project
rmdir empty_folder
rm -rf old_project
```

### Practice Exercise

```bash
mkdir practice
cd practice
touch test.txt
cd ..
rm -rf practice
```

---

## 5. File Operations

### Essential Commands

* `mv` – Move or rename files
* `cp` – Copy files and directories
* `cat` – View file contents
* `echo` – Print text or save it into files

### Example Use Cases

```bash
echo "Learning Linux is fun!" > linux.txt
cat linux.txt
cp linux.txt backup.txt
mv linux.txt renamed.txt
```

### Practice Exercise

```bash
touch notes.txt
echo "Linux is powerful." > notes.txt
cat notes.txt
cp notes.txt copy.txt
mv copy.txt final.txt
```

## 6. Editing Files with `vim`

### Introduction to `vim`

`vim` is a powerful terminal-based text editor. It is useful in environments where GUI editors are not available — such as over SSH or in minimal installations.

### Modes in `vim`

* **Normal Mode**: Navigation, copying, deleting
* **Insert Mode (`i`)**: For typing and editing text
* **Command Mode (`:`)**: Used to save, quit, or run commands

### Common Commands

* `vim file.txt` – Open or create a file
* `i` – Switch to insert mode
* `Esc` – Return to normal mode
* `:w` – Save the file
* `:q` – Quit the editor
* `:wq` – Save and quit
* `:q!` – Force quit without saving

### Practice Exercise

```bash
vim myfile.txt
# Press 'i' to enter insert mode
# Type: Hello Linux!
# Press 'Esc', then type ':wq' and press Enter
cat myfile.txt
```

---

## 7. Practical Exercises (Mini Project)

### Objective

Create a basic project folder using CLI and perform essential file operations.

### Steps

```bash
mkdir -p my_project/src my_project/docs
touch my_project/README.md my_project/src/main.py
echo "# Project Title" > my_project/README.md
cat my_project/README.md
cp my_project/README.md my_project/docs/README_COPY.md
rm my_project/docs/README_COPY.md
```
