# Introduction to Git and GitHub

---

This comprehensive lesson breaks down the fundamentals of Git and GitHub, providing clear explanations and practical activities for beginners to grasp version control and collaborative coding.

> **Objective**: Understand what Git and GitHub are, and recognize their importance in software development.

---

## What is Git?

> **Definition**: Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system (DVCS).  
> Think of it as a sophisticated "undo" button for your entire project, but with the added power of tracking every single change ever made.

---

## Why Use Git?

Git helps with:

- **Version Control**: Git meticulously records every modification to your files over time. You can easily see who made what changes and revert to any previous state of your project.
- **Collaboration**: It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. Git provides mechanisms to merge different contributions seamlessly.
- **Error Recovery**: Made a catastrophic mistake? Git lets you easily roll back to a stable, working version of your code.
- **Experimentation**: Want to try out a new feature without breaking the main project? Git's branching capabilities allow you to create isolated environments for experimentation.
- **History Tracking**: Provides a clear, detailed history of all project changes, making debugging and understanding code evolution much easier.

---

## What is GitHub?

> **Definition**: GitHub is the world's leading web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git.  
> While Git is the tool you use on your local machine, GitHub is like the social network and cloud storage for your Git repositories.

### How It Complements Git:

- **Centralized Hosting**: Provides a remote location to store your Git repositories, making them accessible from anywhere. This acts as a backup and a central point for team members to sync their work.
- **Collaboration Features**: Beyond just hosting, GitHub offers powerful features like:
  - **Pull Requests (PRs)**: A mechanism for proposing changes, discussing them with teammates, and getting code reviewed before merging into the main project.
  - **Issue Tracking**: Tools to manage tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
  - **Community**: A vast community of developers, making it easy to discover open-source projects, contribute, and learn from others.

---

## Setting Up Git and GitHub

> **Objective**: Equip students with the necessary tools by installing Git and creating their GitHub accounts.

### Installing Git

- **Windows**:  
  Download the Git Bash installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com). Follow the default installation steps. (Git Bash is highly recommended for its Unix-like command line.)

- **macOS**:  
  - **Easiest way**: Run the following in Terminal:
    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```
    Git is included.
  - **Alternative**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) or use Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install git
    ```

- **Linux**:  
  Use your distribution's package manager:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install git        # Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo yum install git            # Fedora/RHEL
  ````

**Verification**:
After installation, open a terminal or Git Bash and run:

```bash
git --version
```

This confirms Git is installed and shows the installed version.

---

## Creating a GitHub Account

### Steps:

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com).
2. Click **"Sign up"** and follow the prompts.
3. Choose a unique username and a strong password.
4. Verify your email address.

> **Importance**: This account will be your identity on GitHub and will host your remote repositories.

---

## Configuring Git with Username and Email

> **Purpose**: These configurations are essential because every Git commit you make will include this information. It helps identify who made which changes.

### Commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

### Explanation:

* `git config`: The command to set Git configuration options.
* `--global`: Ensures the configuration applies to all repositories on your computer.
* `user.name`: The name that will appear on your commits.
* `user.email`: The email address associated with your commits (usually matches your GitHub account).

### Verification:

```bash
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
git config --global --list     # Shows all global configs
```

# Basic Git Workflow Guide

## Objective

**Learn the fundamental Git commands to initialize a repository, track file changes, and commit snapshots.**

---

## Git: Three Key Stages of Tracking

Before we dive into commands, it's crucial to understand the three areas Git uses to manage changes:

1. **Working Directory**  
   - This is your local folder where you create, edit, and delete files.
   - Files here are untracked by Git until you explicitly add them.

2. **Staging Area (Index)**  
   - An intermediate holding area.
   - You "stage" files here to mark them for the next commit.
   - Think of it as telling Git: *“This is what I want in the next version snapshot.”*

3. **Local Repository**  
   - The permanent history of your project.
   - Commits from the staging area are stored here with metadata (author, timestamp, message).



## Step-by-Step Git Workflow

###  1. Initialize a Git Repository

> **Command**: `git init`

#### Purpose:
Transform any folder into a Git-enabled project.

####  Example:
```bash
cd my-awesome-project
git init
````

#### Result:

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/my-awesome-project/.git/
```

* A hidden `.git/` directory is created – this contains all version control data.



###  2. Add Files to the Staging Area

> **Command**: `git add <filename>` or `git add .`

####  Purpose:

Move file changes from the working directory into the staging area.

####  Examples:

```bash
git add my_document.txt     # Adds a specific file
git add .                   # Adds all modified and new files
```

#### Notes:

* Use `git add .` carefully — it stages **everything**, including changes you may not intend to commit.
* Even already tracked files must be re-added after modification to update the staging area.



###  3. Commit Staged Changes

> **Command**: `git commit -m "Your descriptive message"`

####  Purpose:

Take a snapshot of all files in the staging area and save it to the local repository.

#### Example:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial project setup with README"
```

####  Explanation:

* `-m`: Supplies a short message describing the commit.
* Commits are atomic units of change. Write messages that clearly state *what* was done and *why*.

>  Good commit messages help collaborators (and future-you!) understand the project’s evolution.



###  4. Check Status and History

####  A. Check Current Status

> **Command**: `git status`

####  Purpose:

See which files are:

* Untracked
* Modified but not staged
* Staged and ready to commit

####  Example:

```bash
git status
```

####  Output Examples:

* `Untracked files:` → New files Git isn’t tracking yet
* `Changes not staged for commit:` → Modified but not added
* `Changes to be committed:` → Ready to commit
* `nothing to commit, working tree clean` → Everything is saved



#### B. View Commit History

> **Command**: `git log`

####  Purpose:

Display past commits on the current branch.

####  Example:

```bash
git log
```

####  Optional Views:

```bash
git log --oneline                        # Condensed view
git log --graph --oneline --all         # Visual tree of commits
```



##  Hands-on Activity: Practice the Workflow

> **Objective**: Go through the full Git cycle from creating a project to committing changes.


###  Step-by-Step Practice

1. **Create a New Folder**

   ```bash
   mkdir my-first-git-project
   cd my-first-git-project
   ```

2. **Initialize Git**

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Create a Text File**

   ```bash
   touch README.md
   ```

   * Add content using your preferred text editor:

     * Windows: `notepad README.md`
     * macOS: `open -e README.md`
     * Linux: `vim README.md` or any editor

4. **Check Status**

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

5. **Add File to Staging**

   ```bash
   git add README.md
   ```

6. **Check Status Again**

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

7. **Commit the File**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Added README file"
   ```

8. **Check Commit History**

   ```bash
   git log
   ```

9. **Modify the File**

   * Add more text to `README.md`

10. **Check Status Again**

```bash
git status
```

11. **Stage and Commit the Change**

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Updated README with project details"
```

12. **View History**

```bash
git log
```

# Lesson 4: Working with Remote Repositories

---

> **Objective**: Learn how to connect a local Git repository to a remote GitHub repository and synchronize changes.

---

## Creating a GitHub Repository

### Steps:

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. On the GitHub dashboard, click the green **"New"** button (or the **+** sign in the top right and select **"New repository"**).
3. Give your repository a meaningful name (e.g., `my-first-git-project`).
4. Choose **Public** or **Private** (for this lesson, **Public** is fine).
5. **Important**: Do **NOT** initialize with a README, `.gitignore`, or license. We want to push an existing local repository.
6. Click **"Create repository."**

>  GitHub will show setup instructions. Look for:  
> “**…or push an existing repository from the command line**”  
> Copy the provided URL (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/my-first-git-project.git`)

---

## Linking Local to Remote: `git remote add origin <repo-url>`

### Purpose:

Establish a connection between your local Git repository and the remote GitHub repository.  
`origin` is the conventional name for the primary remote.

### Command:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-first-git-project.git
````

### Explanation:

* `git remote`: Manages remote repositories.
* `add`: Adds a new remote.
* `origin`: Default short name for the remote.
* `<repo-url>`: The repository URL copied from GitHub.

### Verification:

```bash
git remote -v
```

---

## Pushing Changes to GitHub

### First Time Push:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

* `-u` / `--set-upstream`: Links `origin/main` as the default upstream.
* `origin`: Remote name.
* `main`: Local branch name (default name instead of `master`).

### Subsequent Pushes:

```bash
git push
```

### Authentication:

* Git may prompt you to log in via GitHub credentials or browser.
* A **Personal Access Token (PAT)** may be needed.
* On Windows/macOS, **Git Credential Manager** may handle this automatically.

---

## Pulling Changes from GitHub

### Purpose:

Fetch and merge changes from GitHub to your local branch.

### Command:

```bash
git pull
```

### Explanation:

* `git pull` = `git fetch` + `git merge`
* Keeps your local branch updated with changes from others (or yourself from another machine).

---

##  Activity: Synchronize Repositories

1. **Create GitHub Repo**: As explained above.
2. **Link Remote**:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
   ```
3. **First Push**:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

    Check files appear on GitHub.

### Simulate Collaboration

* **Option A (Simple)**:

  * Go to your GitHub repo in the browser.
  * Edit `README.md` directly.
  * Commit the change on GitHub.

* **Option B (Realistic)**:

  * Clone to another directory:

    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url> my-second-copy
    ```
  * Make and push a change from the new clone.
  * Return to the original project and pull:

    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

---

# Lesson 5: Branching and Collaboration

---

> **Objective**: Understand how to use branches for isolated development and collaborate using Pull Requests.

---

## Understanding Branches

> A branch is an independent line of development.

### Why Use Branches?

* **Isolation**: Safely develop features without affecting the main codebase.
* **Parallel Development**: Multiple team members work simultaneously.
* **Experimentation**: Try new ideas safely.
* **Bug Fixes**: Patch issues without disrupting ongoing work.

> The `main` (formerly `master`) branch is your stable, production-ready branch.

---

## Creating a New Branch

```bash
git branch feature/my-new-feature
```

* Use `git branch` to list branches.
* Current branch is marked with `*`.

---

## Switching Between Branches

```bash
git checkout feature/my-new-feature
```

### Shortcut:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

> Creates and switches to the new branch in one step.

---

## Merging Branches

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/my-new-feature
```

### Merge Types:

* **Fast-forward**: When `main` hasn’t changed.
* **Three-way merge**: When both branches have diverged.

---

## Opening a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub

### Workflow:

1. Push the feature branch:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```
2. Navigate to your repo on GitHub.
3. Click **"Compare & pull request"** or go to the **Pull Requests** tab → **New pull request**.
4. Select base and compare branches.
5. Add a clear title and description.
6. Assign reviewers (optional).
7. Click **"Create pull request"**.

### Benefits:

* **Code Review**
* **Discussion**
* **Automated Checks**
* **Change Tracking**

---

## Activity: Branching and PR Flow

1. Ensure `main` is up-to-date:

   ```bash
   git pull
   git status
   ```
2. Create and switch branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b develop-feature
   ```
3. Make changes, then:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added new feature"
   git push -u origin develop-feature
   ```
4. Create a PR on GitHub.
5. Merge and pull updates locally:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   ```
6. Optional: Delete branch:

   ```bash
   git branch -d develop-feature
   git push origin --delete develop-feature
   ```

---

# Lesson 6: Best Practices and Troubleshooting

---

> **Objective**: Learn Git best practices and how to handle common issues like merge conflicts.

---

## Always Pull Before Pushing

### Why?

* Avoids merge conflicts.
* Syncs with changes others pushed.
* Think of it like pulling the latest document version before editing.

---

## Use Meaningful Commit Messages

### Format:

```
<type>: <short message>

<optional detailed description>
```

Examples:

* Good: `Fix: Correct layout issue on mobile`
* Bad: `Changes`, `Stuff`

### Benefits:

* Easier to understand history.
* Better for reviews and debugging.

---

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

### What is a Merge Conflict?

Occurs when changes from two branches clash on the same lines.

Conflict markers:

```plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is your version.
=======
This is the other branch's version.
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

---

### Steps to Resolve:

1. Run:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```
2. Open the conflicted file(s).
3. Edit manually to remove conflict markers.
4. Mark as resolved:

   ```bash
   git add <filename>
   ```
5. Commit the merge:

   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

---

## Activity: Simulate and Resolve Merge Conflicts

1. Ensure `main` is clean:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   ```

2. Create Branch A:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b conflict-branch-A
   ```

   * Edit line 5 of `README.md` → Add “This is Line A content”
   * Commit the change.

3. Create Branch B:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b conflict-branch-B
   ```

   * Edit line 5 with different content → “This is Line B content”
   * Commit the change.

4. Merge A into `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge conflict-branch-A
   ```

5. Attempt to merge B:

   ```bash
   git merge conflict-branch-B
   ```

   Conflict will occur.

6. Resolve:

   * Use `git status` to find conflict.
   * Open file, resolve, save.
   * Add and commit:

     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit
     ```

7. View history:

   ```bash
   git log --oneline --graph
   ```

8. Push:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
