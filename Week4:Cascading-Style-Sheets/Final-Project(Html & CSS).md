# Restaurant Website Project Instructions

## **Project Overview**
Create a visually appealing, fully responsive restaurant website using HTML and CSS. You will implement all major CSS concepts, including selectors, box model, typography, backgrounds, cascade, specificity, inheritance, responsive design, pseudo-classes/elements, and transitions.

---

## **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: Plan Your Website Structure**
**Instructions:**
- List and define each major section of your restaurant website:
  - Header (Logo, Restaurant Name, Navigation)
  - Hero Section (Welcome message, background image/gradient, call-to-action)
  - Menu Section (Categorized menu items)
  - Reservation Section (Booking form)
  - Gallery Section (Photos)
  - About Us Section (Story, staff bios, awards)
  - Testimonials Section (Customer reviews)
  - Contact Section (Contact info, map, social links)
  - Footer (Copyright, social media)
- Sketch or outline your intended layout on paper or a digital tool.

**Expected Outcome:**  
A clear plan of your website's structure and layout, serving as a blueprint for your HTML.

---

### **Step 2: Create the HTML Skeleton**
**Instructions:**
- Create an HTML file that includes all planned sections as `<header>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, etc.
- Use semantic tags and add placeholder content (headings, paragraphs, images, lists, forms).

**Expected Outcome:**  
A complete HTML structure with all elements present, ready for styling.

---

### **Step 3: Organize Your Assets**
**Instructions:**
- Prepare and organize all images (logo, dishes, chef, gallery, map, social icons) in an `images` folder.
- Name files clearly for easy reference.

**Expected Outcome:**  
A well-organized assets directory for use in your website.

---

### **Step 4: Link an External CSS File**
**Instructions:**
- Create a `style.css` file in your project folder.
- Link this stylesheet in your HTML fileâ€™s `<head>` section.

**Expected Outcome:**  
Your HTML file correctly references an external CSS file for styling.

---

### **Step 5: Apply CSS Selectors**
**Instructions:**
- Style elements using a variety of selectors:
  - Element selectors (e.g., `header`, `section`)
  - Class selectors (e.g., `.menu-card`, `.cta-btn`)
  - ID selectors (e.g., `#logo`)
  - Group selectors (e.g., `section, footer`)
  - Universal selector (e.g., `*`)
- Use pseudo-classes (e.g., `:hover`, `:focus`) and pseudo-elements (e.g., `::after`).

**Expected Outcome:**  
Demonstrated use of multiple selectors and pseudo-classes/elements across your CSS file.

---

### **Step 6: Style Layout with Box Model, Flexbox, and Grid**
**Instructions:**
- Apply margin, padding, border, and background properties to create space and separation.
- Use Flexbox for horizontal and vertical alignment (e.g., navigation, header, testimonials).
- Use CSS Grid for complex layouts (e.g., menu cards, photo gallery).

**Expected Outcome:**  
A visually organized layout with properly spaced and aligned sections, cards, and images.

---

### **Step 7: Customize Typography**
**Instructions:**
- Select appropriate fonts and apply them site-wide.
- Style headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, and menu item names for emphasis and readability.
- Adjust font size, weight, color, and alignment as needed.

**Expected Outcome:**  
Consistent and attractive typography throughout the website.

---

### **Step 8: Implement Colors and Backgrounds**
**Instructions:**
- Use CSS to add color themes, gradients, and background images to sections as appropriate.
- Style buttons and call-to-action elements with color and hover effects.
- Ensure color contrast for accessibility.

**Expected Outcome:**  
A visually appealing color palette and backgrounds that enhance user experience.

---

### **Step 9: Use Cascade, Specificity, and Inheritance**
**Instructions:**
- Structure your CSS so that general styles are overridden by more specific selectors as needed.
- Use classes and IDs to target elements for unique styling.
- Allow inherited properties (e.g., font, color) to flow from parent to child elements where appropriate.

**Expected Outcome:**  
Effective use of CSS cascade, specificity, and inheritance to control styling.

---

### **Step 10: Make the Site Responsive**
**Instructions:**
- Add media queries for mobile and tablet breakpoints.
- Adjust layouts, font sizes, and element spacing for smaller screens.
- Ensure navigation and forms are easy to use on all devices.

**Expected Outcome:**  
A website that displays and functions well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

---

### **Step 11: Enhance Interactivity**
**Instructions:**
- Add transitions to buttons, images, and cards for smooth hover effects.
- Use pseudo-classes to change styles on user interaction (hover, focus, active).
- Provide visual feedback on form elements (e.g., focus states, validation).

**Expected Outcome:**  
Interactive and engaging elements that respond to user actions.

---

### **Step 12: Finalize and Test**
**Instructions:**
- Thoroughly test your website in multiple browsers and device sizes.
- Validate your HTML and CSS for errors.
- Ensure accessibility (alt text for images, sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation).

**Expected Outcome:**  
A polished, error-free, accessible restaurant website ready for deployment.
