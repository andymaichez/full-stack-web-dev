Learning Principles (Reiterated & Expanded)

    1. *"Code Daily (Minimum 1 Hour Consistent Practice): Consistency is key. Even small commits each day build momentum and solidifies learning."*
    
    2. *Build a Public Portfolio on GitHub: Every project, from the simplest to the most complex, should live on GitHub. Your commits, branching, and PRs tell a story of your growth and proficiency. This is your living resume.*
    
    3. *Debug Systematically: Master browser developer tools (console, elements, network, debugger) and backend debugging techniques (e.g., console.log, VS Code debugger for Node.js). Reproduce, isolate, and then fix.*
    
    4. *Join Communities: Engage with developers on platforms like freeCodeCamp Forum, Reactiflux Discord, Stack Overflow, and local meetups. Ask questions, answer questions, and learn from others.*
    
    5. *Pair Programming/Study Buddies: Find peers on platforms like CodeNewbie or online forums. Explaining concepts to others reinforces your understanding, and collaborative problem-solving is invaluable.*
